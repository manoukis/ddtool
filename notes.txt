# Agenda for call with Sean Farnum @ CDFA about ddtool

## Temperature input

What is the temperature input for the whole tool (replacing both COPY12.BAS and COPY32.BAS)?
We shouldn't use the existing binary files like LAAR17.
Are there existing text/excel files with the temperature data (sounds like it from instructions)?
	Are those files just date, minT, maxT?
Is there an existing database (Access) we should use instead?  That would take some figuring out.

Assuming text/excel files:
Are they put in a particular directory structure?  We should do that if not alraedy there.
What exactly is that structure?
If this is done right, should just be able to specify station and date instead of files.

For future, we can probably automate going from sensor/hobo to text/excel files of min & max T, or database.
That is a bigger topic though.


## Output/results

What is the desired output format?

Might need Sean to run an example since it has problem reading the binary data format on my computer.


## Configuration

Having a small configuration file would be far better than entering things each time it is run.
Not really a question.
