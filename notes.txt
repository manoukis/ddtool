## Temperature input

Temperature input will be, for now, dump from Access database.
Apparently contains all data for all sites.
example file: testfiles/Temps_20001.xlsx


Write an additional tool to read old COPY12.BAS files like LAAR17 and output to an excel file.

For future:
Getting data directly out of the Access DB seems relatively simple.  
We can probably automate going from sensor/hobo to files of min & max T and/or database.


## Output/results

Just dates of generations are required.  However, some additional info, especially plots, seems good.
